        <em> Version Control System (VCS) or Source Code Manager (SCM):</em>A
        VCS allows you to: revert files back to a previous state, revert the
        entire project back to a previous state, review changes made over time,
        see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who
        introduced an issue and when, and more.
      </p>
      <p>Three of the most popular version control systems are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Subversion</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
      </ul>
<p>There are two main types of version control system models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the centralized model - all users connect to a central, master repository</li>
  <li>the distributed model - each user has the entire repository on their computer</li>
 
</ul>
      <p><em>A version control system (abbreviated as VCS)</em> is a tool that manages different versions of source code. <em>A source code manager (abbreviated as SCM)</em> is another name for a version control system.</p>
  
    <p>The process is add new file/modify existing file, move the changes to the staging index and commit the changes to the repository.</p>
    <p><em>Commit (snapshot):</em> Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini file system. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>
